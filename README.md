# Database Design for ITSM Incident Management System

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the architecture and deployment of a database tailored for an IT Service Management (ITSM) incident management system. It represents a blend of various modeling techniques and technologies to create a robust and functional database system.

## Key Features
- **Integration of ER, EER, and UML Models**: These models were foundational in the database design, ensuring a comprehensive and efficient structure.
- **MySQL Relational Database with 18 Tables**: The database was implemented in MySQL, featuring 18 interconnected tables to handle diverse data requirements.
- **Python for Data Visualization and Insights**: Python was utilized to extract insights and create visual representations of the data, enhancing the interpretability of the systemâ€™s performance.

## Development Process
1. **Problem Statement**: The initial phase involved defining the core objective: designing an ITSM-based incident management system.
2. **Conceptual Modeling**: The project commenced with the creation of a conceptual model using Extended Entity-Relationship (EER) and Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams. This step laid the groundwork for the database structure.
3. **Relational Model Translation**: The EER diagram was translated into a relational model, aligning with the requirements of a MySQL relational database.
4. **SQL Implementation**: The relational model was brought to life using MySQL Workbench, implementing the detailed design into a functional database.
